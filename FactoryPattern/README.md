# Factory pattern - We create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

Step #1: Create an interface(Operation).

Step #2: Implement the interface - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.

Step #3: Create a factory class for Operation(OperationFactory).

Step #4: Create a demo class(OperationFactoryDemo) to demonstrate how factory pattern works.
